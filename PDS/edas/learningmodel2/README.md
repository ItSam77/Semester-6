## Conclusion

The `modelling_rf.py` script implements a complete machine learning pipeline for employee attrition prediction using Random Forest. Here's what the script does:

1. **Data Processing**:
   - Loads employee data from 'processed_data.csv'
   - Splits data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets
   - Handles class imbalance using SMOTE technique

2. **Model Implementation**:
   - Implements Random Forest Classifier with optimized parameters:
     - 50 trees (n_estimators=50)
     - Maximum depth of 30
     - Square root of features for each split
     - No bootstrap sampling

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Performs comprehensive model evaluation including:
     - Test set accuracy
     - Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)
     - Confusion matrix
     - 5-fold cross-validation

4. **Model Persistence**:
   - Saves the trained model as 'model.pkl' using joblib
   - Enables model reuse for future predictions

The script follows best practices in machine learning by:
- Using stratified sampling to maintain class distribution
- Implementing cross-validation for robust performance estimation
- Providing detailed evaluation metrics
- Including comprehensive logging and documentation
